<h3><b>GUIDELINES TO THE FINAL YEAR STUDENTS FOR CAMPUS INTERVIEW</b><br></h3>
<h4>
<p>Campus recruitment of final year students is arranged by the center. However, it may please be noted that the institute does not guarantee employment to all students.
The students are advised not to have any subject backlogs by the time they enter Final Year.
</p><ul>
<li>In order to provide a fair deal to all concerned, the following points regarding the procedure going to be followed may be noted for guidance:
</li><li>Further processing of cases for students will be stopped in the event of occurrence of any one of the following:<br>
• If a firm offers or confirmation of selection is received from an organization irrespective of it being accepted or not accepted by the student.<br>
• If a maximum of two active short-listings are in hand. In the event one active short-listing gets converted into ‘rejection’, the student’s case is permitted to be proceeded further with recruitment. Until such time, a maximum of two active short-listings are obtained.
</li><li>The following situations would represent active short-listing:<br>
• Students who appear in some part of the campus interview i.e. tests, group discussions and do not show up for the subsequent selection round.<br>
• Production of false or incorrect information. Students called for interviews purely on the basis of bio-data forwarded by the center without any screening process
being conducted at the institute.<br>
• Students who are called for interviews but do not attend the same. These would also include cases where information is given to the organization.<br><br>
<p>In certain exceptional cases, an organization or repute visits the institute at a later date when most of students have been selected or active short listed (two times) and sufficient number of students are not available for interview.
PAT center may allow the selected or shortlisted students (two times) to appear for interviews of such types of organization. This rule is solely at the discretion of the principal and should not be quoted as precedent. Preference will be given to those students who are not selected or short listed for the final interviews.
Bio-data will only be accepted between 3.00 p.m. to 5.00 p.m. on all working days in the office of the PAT. The center will not maintain records enter into correspondence about recruitments done directly by organizations, in response to advertisements in the news papers/employment news or any other agency.
Notice for calling bio-data will be displayed at the notice board outside the office of PAT. The students are advised to see the notice board regularly. At least twice daily.
Cases, which are not covered by the guidelines given above, will be decided in merits. All the final year students are advised to please cooperate and comply with these guidelines.</p>

</h4><h3>ATTENDING THE INTERVIEW</h3>
<h4>
<ul>
<li>Thorough preparation for the interview will enable you to face the interview with confidence.
Remember that each interviewer is different from others in characteristic ways and so, look for ways to adapt to each one as a unique individual.
Despite these differences in the personality of the interviewers, the following suggestions will be useful for most job interviews.
</li><li><b>Be Punctual and Fresh</b><br>
It would be a poor first impression, if you were not in time for the interview. Program your travel plans, so that you get sufficient rest and time to refresh and dress properly for the interview. Be at the venue at least fifteen minutes before the interview. Go to the interview with a fresh and an open mind.
</li><li><b>Be Dressed Properly</b><br>
An appropriate dress for the interview with good grooming creates a very good first impression on the interviewer. Though the personal choice of the dress for the occasion might vary, it is advisable to dress smartly but moderately for the interview, so that you may look neither negligent nor gaudy.
</li><li><b>Entering The Interview Room</b><br>
Before entering the interview room, adjust your dress and touch up on your appearance. Before entering, enquire by asking ‘May I come in sirs?’ If permitted, close the door softly and walk in with confidence towards the chair. Face the interview panel confidently and wish them appropriately, depending on the time of the day. If the member of the interview board wants to shake hands with you, then offer a firm grip maintaining eye-to-eye contact and a smile. Ask permission to sit down by saying ‘May I sit down sir?’, if the interviewer has not already asked you to take your seat.
Please remember that during the first few minutes, you can strongly influence the interviewers’ assessment of your personality. Hence, the first impression that you give in the interview is very important.
</li><li><b>Be Warm and Responsive</b><br>
Throughout your meeting with the interviewer, you should be warm, friendly and confident. Make immediate eye contact with the interviewer. You may feel anxious, but remember that the interviewer is after all trying to find a suitable person for a job in his organization and it is up to you to convince him that you are the right person for the job. It offers you a challenge to communicate on this aspect and try to be as enthusiastic as possible about the opportunity. Try to maintain eye contact and a cheerful disposition throughout the interview. It shows your self-confidence and poise and greatly enhances the personal impact.
</li><li><b>Be Poised</b><br>
Your proper posture during the interview adds to your personality. Sit straight with hands under the table to be used only when emphasizing point or to illustrate through writing. Avoid playing with your tie or shaking legs, etc.
</li><li><b>Follow The Interviewer’s Lead</b><br>
Interviewers differ widely in their manner of operating. Most interviewers expect to control the proceedings, and you will only make a bad impression if you try to take over. Follow the interviewer’s lead in answering the questions. But, if you are clever and tactful, you can focus the interview on the topics in which you are strong.
</li><li><b>Be a Good Listener</b><br>
It is imperative for you to listen carefully to the questions being asked. If a question is not clear, seek clarification in a polite way. Seeking a clarification is far better than giving an irrelevant answer. Watch for verbal and non-verbal cues that come your way.
</li><li><b>Sell Yourself</b><br>
There is no better advice that can be given to you than this. You already know that the interviewer wants to make a judgment of what kind of person you are. Help him to do so in a positive way, by volunteering positive information about you in brief and lucid way. Like a salesman, stress your positive features and downplay your negative features. The objective even when discussing your weak points is either to minimize them or turn them into an advantage.
</li><li><b>Market Your Skills</b><br>
After you have analyzed the position and researched the organization, you are now in a position to review your qualifications for the position. Knowing what you have to offer is crucial. Expressing yourself clearly and concisely is a key element of effective interviewing.
